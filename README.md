# react-spa-boilerplate
Simple boilerplate using React, Node, Express to display Hello World on localhost.

### Getting Started:

Clone or fork this repository to your local machine.

Run ```npm i``` in your terminal to install the modules. Then run ```npm start``` to start the local server.

Finally, navigate to http://localhost:5000


### Different use cases:

In my experience there are four major ways in which to build upon this boilerplate. Each branch in this repo represents a different use case.

* master (react)

* react-redux

* node-server

* redux-app-with-node-server

### What each module does:

Modules included in package.json are the bare minimum to get the local server running and Hello World to render on the screen.
